üéØ KEY BREAKTHROUGH: ULTRA-DENSE PAG REVOLUTION
The Ultra-Dense PAG integration represents a paradigm shift in chess position representation:

Traditional Problem: Limited 12-dimensional piece features, basic position encoding
RivalAI Solution: Revolutionary 350+ dimensional ultra-dense PAG features with 95+ dimensional critical squares

Every chess position now encoded with:
‚Ä¢ 350+ tactical and strategic features per piece (vs 12 basic features)
‚Ä¢ 95+ rich features per critical square (vs 1 basic feature)  
‚Ä¢ 256+ dimensional edge relationships capturing complex piece interactions
‚Ä¢ Automatic fallback to compatible basic features when Rust engine unavailable
‚Ä¢ Memory-optimized processing preventing 33GB training issues

This breakthrough solves the "feature poverty" problem that limits traditional chess AI by providing ultra-rich position representations that capture subtle tactical and strategic patterns.
