A modern chess engine that combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), featuring a novel position representation system called CHESS (Chess Heterogeneous Encoding State System). The engine uses Positional Adjacency Graphs (PAG) to represent chess positions as rich graph structures, capturing piece relationships and strategic dynamics.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

RivalAI consists of three main components:

### 1. Rust Engine Core (`/engine/`)
High-performance chess engine written in Rust with multiple interfaces:

- **Server Mode** (`server.rs`): WebSocket server with REST API for web interface

**Neural Network Architecture:**
- 4-layer Graph Neural Network with Graph Attention (GAT)
- 256 hidden dimensions, 4 attention heads per layer
- Policy head: 5,312 possible moves (including all promotion combinations)
- Value head: Position evaluation (-1 to +1)

**Training Infrastructure:**
- Unified storage system for all game types
- Automated batch processing and archiving
- Background training with community game protection
- UCI tournament data integration
- Self-play generation with adaptive scaling
- Comprehensive metrics and visualization

### 3. React Web Interface (`/engine/web/`)
Modern web interface with real-time features:

- Interactive chessboard with move validation

### Community Mode
Collaborative gameplay where multiple players vote on moves:
- 10-second voting windows with real-time countdown
- Democratic move selection with tie-breaking
- Vote modification during voting periods

- Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- Automatic engine response after community moves

### UCI Tournament Mode
Automated competitive play against other engines:
- Full UCI protocol compliance with proper time controls

### Position Representation (PAG)
The Positional Adjacency Graph system represents chess positions as:
- **Piece Nodes**: 12 features per piece (type, color, position, mobility)
- **Square Nodes**: 1 feature per critical square (occupancy, control)
- **Edge Relationships**: Attacks, defenses, pins, forks, and strategic connections
- **Global Features**: Game phase, material balance, castling rights
